    explanation: `Buyer’s premium = 5% of $30,000 = $1,500. Total subject to commission = $30,000 + $1,500 = $31,500. Commission = 10% of $31,500 = 0.10 × 31,500 = $3,150? Wait—this is 3,150, not 3,750. The correct commission is 10% of hammer ONLY or hammer plus premium depending on contract. If on hammer plus premium, it is $3,150.
